## SQLite Documentation

This repository contains scripts used to generate the documentation
for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).  This repository also contains
much of the content of the documentation, though some of the content
is extracted from special comments in the SQLite sources and in the
[TH3](https://www.sqlite.org/th3.html) sources.

The repository also contains the source code to the custom web server
that is used to run the SQLite website.  See
The [misc/althttpd.c](/file/misc/althttpd.c) file.
