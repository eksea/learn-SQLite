<title>Features Of SQLite</title>

<h1 align=center>Features Of SQLite</h1>

<p><ul>
<li><a href="transactional.html">Transactions</a>
    are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID)
    even after system crashes and power failures.</li>
<li><a href="zeroconf.html">Zero-configuration</a>
     - no setup or administration needed.</li>
<li>[Full-featured SQL] implementation
    with advanced capabilities like [partial indexes],
    [indexes on expressions], [json1|JSON],
    and [common table expressions].
    (<a href="omitted.html">Omitted features</a>)</li>
<li>A complete database is stored in a 
    <a href="onefile.html">single cross-platform disk file</a>.
    Great for use as an [application file format].</li>
<li>Supports terabyte-sized databases and gigabyte-sized strings
    and blobs.  (See <a href="limits.html">limits.html</a>.)
<li>Small code [footprint]: 
    less than 500KiB fully configured or much less
    with optional features omitted.</li>
<li>Simple, easy to use <a href="cintro.html">API</a>.</li>
<li>Fast:  In some cases, SQLite is 
    [faster than the filesystem|faster than direct filesystem I/O]
<li>Written in ANSI-C.  <a href="tclsqlite.html">TCL bindings</a> included.
    Bindings for dozens of other languages available separately.</li>
<li>Well-commented source code with
    [test coverage |100% branch test coverage].</li>
<li>Available as a 
    <a href="amalgamation.html">single ANSI-C source-code file</a> 
    that is [how to compile|easy to compile] and hence is easy
    to add into a larger project.
<li><a href="selfcontained.html">Self-contained</a>:
    no external dependencies.</li>
<li>Cross-platform: Android, *BSD, iOS, Linux, Mac, Solaris, VxWorks, 
    and Windows (Win32, WinCE, WinRT)
    are supported out of the box.  Easy to port to other systems.
<li>Sources are in the <a href="copyright.html">public domain</a>.
    Use for any purpose.</li>
<li>Comes with a standalone [command-line interface]
    (CLI) client that can be used to administer SQLite databases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggested Uses For SQLite:</h2>

<p><ul>
<li><p><b>Database For The Internet Of Things.</b>
SQLite is popular choice for the database engine in cellphones,
PDAs, MP3 players, set-top boxes, and other electronic gadgets.
SQLite has a small code footprint, makes efficient use of memory,
disk space, and disk bandwidth, is highly reliable, and requires
no maintenance from a Database Administrator.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Application File Format.</b>
Rather than using fopen() to write XML, JSON, CSV,
or some proprietary format into
disk files used by your application, use an SQLite database.
You'll avoid having to write and troubleshoot a parser, your data
will be more easily accessible and cross-platform, and your updates
will be transactional.  ([application file-format | more...])</p></li>

<li><p><b>Website Database.</b>
Because it requires no configuration and stores information in ordinary
disk files, SQLite is a popular choice as the database to back small
to medium-sized websites.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Stand-in For An Enterprise RDBMS.</b>
SQLite is often used as a surrogate for an enterprise RDBMS for
demonstration purposes or for testing.  SQLite is fast and requires
no setup, which takes a lot of the hassle out of testing and which
makes demos perky and easy to launch.</p></li>
