<p>The PRAGMA statement is an SQL extension specific to SQLite and used to 
modify the operation of the SQLite library or to query the SQLite library for 
internal (non-table) data. The PRAGMA statement is issued using the same
interface as other SQLite commands (e.g. [SELECT], [INSERT]) but is
different in the following important respects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific pragma statements may be removed and others added in future
    releases of SQLite. There is no guarantee of backwards compatibility.
<li>^No error messages are generated if an unknown pragma is issued.
    Unknown pragmas are simply ignored. This means if there is a typo in 
    a pragma statement the library does not inform the user of the fact.
<li>^Some pragmas take effect during the SQL compilation stage, not the
    execution stage. This means if using the C-language [sqlite3_prepare()], 
    [sqlite3_step()], [sqlite3_finalize()] API (or similar in a wrapper 
    interface), the pragma may run during the [sqlite3_prepare()] call,
    not during the [sqlite3_step()] call as normal SQL statements do.
    ^Or the pragma might run during sqlite3_step() just like normal
    SQL statements.  Whether or not the pragma runs during sqlite3_prepare()
    or sqlite3_step() depends on the pragma and on the specific release
    of SQLite.
<li>The pragma command is specific to SQLite and is
    not compatible with any other SQL database engine.
</ul>

<p>The C-language API for SQLite provides the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
[sqlite3_file_control | file control] which gives [VFS] implementations the
opportunity to add new PRAGMA statements or to override the meaning of
built-in PRAGMA statements.</p>

RecursiveBubbleDiagram pragma-stmt pragma-value
</tcl>

<p>
^A pragma can take either zero or one argument.  ^The argument is may be either
in parentheses or it may be separated from the pragma name by an equal sign.
^The two syntaxes yield identical results.
^(In many pragmas, the argument is a boolean.  The boolean can be one of:
</p>

<center>
<b>1 yes true on<br>0 no false off</b>
</center>)^

<p>^Keyword arguments can optionally appear in quotes.  
(Example:  <tt>'yes' &#91;FALSE&#93;</tt>.) Some pragmas
takes a string literal as their argument.  When pragma takes a keyword
argument, it will usually also take a numeric equivalent as well.
For example, "0" and "no" mean the same thing, as does "1" and "yes".
When querying the value of a setting, many pragmas return the number
rather than the keyword.</p>

<p>^A pragma may have an optional <yyterm>schema-name</yyterm>
before the pragma name.
^The <yyterm>schema-name</yyterm> is the name of an [ATTACH]-ed database 
or "main" or "temp" for the main and the TEMP databases.  ^If the optional
schema name is omitted, "main" is assumed.  ^In some pragmas, the schema
name is meaningless and is simply ignored.  In the documentation below,
pragmas for which the schema name is meaningful are shown with a
"<i>schema.</i>" prefix.</p>

<tcl>
Section {PRAGMA functions} pragfunc {{PRAGMA functions} {PRAGMA function}}
</tcl>

<p>
PRAGMAs that return results and that have no side-effects can be 
accessed from ordinary [SELECT] statements as [table-valued functions].
For each participating PRAGMA, the corresponding table-valued function
has the same name as the PRAGMA with a 7-character "pragma_" prefix.
The PRAGMA argument and schema, if any, are passed as arguments to
the table-valued function.

<p>For example, information about the columns in an index can be
read using the [index_info pragma] as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
PRAGMA index_info('idx52');
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Or, the same content can be read using:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT * FROM pragma_index_info('idx52');
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The advantage of the table-valued function format is that the query
can return just a subset of the PRAGMA columns, can include a WHERE clause,
can use aggregate functions, and the table-valued function can be just
one of several data sources in a join.
For example, to get a list of all indexed columns in a schema, one
could query:

<blockquote><pre>
SELECT DISTINCT m.name || '.' || ii.name AS 'indexed-columns'
  FROM sqlite_master AS m,
       pragma_index_list(m.name) AS il,
       pragma_index_info(il.name) AS ii
 WHERE m.type='table'
 ORDER BY 1;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Additional notes:
<ul>
<li><p>
Table-valued functions exist only for built-in PRAGMAs, not for PRAGMAs
defined using the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control.
<li><p>
Table-valued functions exist only for PRAGMAs that return results and
that have no side-effects.
<li><p>
This feature could be used to implement
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_schema | information schema]
by first creating a separate schema using
<blockquote><pre>
[ATTACH] ':memory:' AS 'information_schema';
</pre></blockquote>
Then creating
[VIEW|VIEWs] in that schema that implement the official information schema
tables using table-valued PRAGMA functions.
<li><p>
This feature is experimental and is subject to change.  Further documentation
will become available if and when the table-valued functions for PRAGMAs
feature becomes officially supported.
<li><p>
The table-valued functions for PRAGMA feature was added
in SQLite version 3.16.0 ([dateof:3.16.0]).  Prior versions of SQLite
cannot use this feature.

<tcl>Pragma {application_id} {
    <p><b>PRAGMA DB.application_id;
     <br>PRAGMA DB.application_id = </b><i>integer </i><b>;</b>
  
<p>    ^The application_id PRAGMA is used to query or set the 32-bit
       unsigned big-endian "Application ID" integer located at offset
       68 into the [database header].  Applications that use SQLite as their
       [application file-format] should set the Application ID integer to
       a unique integer so that utilities such as 
       [http://www.darwinsys.com/file/ | file(1)] can determine the specific
       file type rather than just reporting "SQLite3 Database".  A list of
       assigned application IDs can be seen by consulting the
       [http://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=magic.txt
        |magic.txt] file in the SQLite source repository.

Pragma {automatic_index} {
    <p>^(<b>PRAGMA automatic_index;
     <br>PRAGMA automatic_index = </b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>

    <p>Query, set, or clear the [automatic indexing] capability.)^
    <p>[Automatic indexing] is enabled by default as of 
    [version 3.7.17] ([dateof:3.7.17]),
    but this might change in future releases of SQLite.
}

Pragma {auto_vacuum} {
    <p><b>PRAGMA DB.auto_vacuum;<br>
          PRAGMA DB.auto_vacuum = </b>
           <i>0 | NONE | 1 | FULL | 2 | INCREMENTAL</i><b>;</b></p>

    <p>Query or set the auto-vacuum status in the database.</p>

    <p>^The default setting for auto-vacuum is 0 or "none",
    unless the [SQLITE_DEFAULT_AUTOVACUUM] compile-time option is used.
    ^The "none" setting means that auto-vacuum is disabled.
    ^When auto-vacuum is disabled and data is deleted data from a database,
    the database file remains the same size.  ^Unused database file 
    pages are added to a "[freelist]" and reused for subsequent inserts.  So
    no database file space is lost.  However, the database file does not
    shrink.  ^In this mode the [VACUUM]
    command can be used to rebuild the entire database file and
    thus reclaim unused disk space.</p>

    <p>^When the auto-vacuum mode is 1  or "full", the freelist pages are
    moved to the end of the database file and the database file is truncated
    to remove the freelist pages at every transaction commit.
    ^(Note, however, that auto-vacuum only truncates the freelist pages
    from the file.  Auto-vacuum does not defragment the database nor
    repack individual database pages the way that the
    [VACUUM] command does.)^  In fact, because
    it moves pages around within the file, auto-vacuum can actually
    make fragmentation worse.</p>

    <p>Auto-vacuuming is only possible if the database stores some
    additional information that allows each database page to be
    traced backwards to its referrer.  ^Therefore, auto-vacuuming must
    be turned on before any tables are created.  It is not possible
    to enable or disable auto-vacuum after a table has been created.</p>

    <p>^When the value of auto-vacuum is 2 or "incremental" then the additional
    information needed to do auto-vacuuming is stored in the database file
    but auto-vacuuming does not occur automatically at each commit as it
    does with auto_vacuum=full.  ^In incremental mode, the separate
    [incremental_vacuum] pragma must
    be invoked to cause the auto-vacuum to occur.</p>

    <p>^The database connection can be changed between full and incremental
    autovacuum mode at any time.  ^However, changing from
    "none" to "full" or "incremental" can only occur when the database 
    is new (no tables
    have yet been created) or by running the [VACUUM] command.  ^To
    change auto-vacuum modes, first use the auto_vacuum pragma to set
    the new desired mode, then invoke the [VACUUM] command to 
    reorganize the entire database file.  ^To change from "full" or
    "incremental" back to "none" always requires running [VACUUM] even
    on an empty database.
    </p>

    <p>^When the auto_vacuum pragma is invoked with no arguments, it
    returns the current auto_vacuum mode.</p>

Pragma busy_timeout {
    <p>^(<b>PRAGMA busy_timeout;
         <br>PRAGMA busy_timeout = </b><i>milliseconds</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>Query or change the setting of the
    [sqlite3_busy_timeout | busy timeout].)^
    This pragma is an alternative to the [sqlite3_busy_timeout()] C-language
    interface which is made available as a pragma for use with language
    bindings that do not provide direct access to [sqlite3_busy_timeout()].

    <p>Each database connection can only have a single
    [sqlite3_busy_handler|busy handler].  This PRAGMA sets the busy handler
    for the process, possibly overwriting any previously set busy handler.
}

Pragma cache_spill {
    <p>^(<b>PRAGMA cache_spill;
         <br>PRAGMA cache_spill=</b><i>boolean</i><b>;
         <br>PRAGMA DB.cache_spill=<i>N</i>;</b>)^</p>

    <p>^(The cache_spill pragma enables or disables the ability of the pager
    to spill dirty cache pages to the database file in the middle of a 
    transaction.)^  ^(Cache_spill is enabled by default)^ and most applications
    should leave it that way as cache spilling is usually advantageous.
    However, a cache spill has the side-effect of acquiring an
    [EXCLUSIVE lock] on the database file.  Hence, some applications that
    have large long-running transactions may want to disable cache spilling
    in order to prevent the application from acquiring an exclusive lock
    on the database until the moment that the transaction [COMMIT]s.
    <p>^(The "PRAGMA cache_spill=<i>N</i>" form of this pragma sets a minimum
    cache size threshold required for spilling to occur.)^ ^(The number of pages
    in cache must exceed both the cache_spill threshold and the maximum cache
    size set by the [PRAGMA cache_size] statement in order for spilling to
    occur.)^
    <p>^(The "PRAGMA cache_spill=<i>boolean</i>" form of this pragma applies
    across all databases attached to the database connection.)^  ^(But the
    "PRAGMA cache_spill=<i>N</i>" form of this statement only applies to
    the "main" schema or whatever other schema is specified as part of the
    statement.)^
}

Pragma cache_size {
    <p>^(<b>PRAGMA DB.cache_size;
       <br>PRAGMA DB.cache_size = </b><i>pages</i><b>;
       <br>PRAGMA DB.cache_size = -</b><i>kibibytes</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>Query or change the suggested maximum number of database disk pages
    that SQLite will hold in memory at once per open database file.)^  Whether
    or not this suggestion is honored is at the discretion of the
    [sqlite3_pcache_methods2 | Application Defined Page Cache].
    The default page cache that is built into SQLite honors the request,
    however alternative application-defined page cache implementations
    may choose to interpret the suggested cache size in different ways
    or to ignore it all together.
    ^The default suggested cache size is -2000, which means the cache size
    is limited to 2048000 bytes of memory.
    ^The default suggested cache size can be altered using the
    [SQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE] compile-time options.
    ^The TEMP database has a default suggested cache size of 0 pages.</p>

    <p>^If the argument N is positive then the suggested cache size is set 
    to N. ^If the argument N is negative, then the
    number of cache pages is adjusted to use approximately abs(N*1024) bytes
    of memory.
    <i>Backwards compatibility note:</i>
    The behavior of cache_size with a negative N
    was different in prior to [version 3.7.10] ([dateof:3.7.10]).  In
    version 3.7.9 and earlier, the number of pages in the cache was set
    to the absolute value of N.</p>

    <p>^When you change the cache size using the cache_size pragma, the
    change only endures for the current session.  ^The cache size reverts
    to the default value when the database is closed and reopened.</p>


}

Pragma case_sensitive_like {
    <p><b>PRAGMA case_sensitive_like = </b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>^(The default behavior of the [LIKE] operator is to ignore case
    for ASCII characters. Hence, by default <b>'a' LIKE 'A'</b> is
    true.)^  ^The case_sensitive_like pragma installs a new application-defined
    LIKE function that is either case sensitive or insensitive depending
    on the value of the case_sensitive_like pragma.
    ^When case_sensitive_like is disabled, the default LIKE behavior is
    expressed.  ^(When case_sensitive_like is enabled, case becomes
    significant.  So, for example,
    <b>'a' LIKE 'A'</b> is false but <b>'a' LIKE 'a'</b> is still true.)^</p>

    <p>^This pragma uses [sqlite3_create_function()] to overload the
    LIKE and GLOB functions, which may override previous implementations
    of LIKE and GLOB registered by the application.  ^(This pragma
    only changes the behavior of the SQL [LIKE] operator.  It does not
    change the behavior of the [sqlite3_strlike()] C-language interface,
    which is always case insensitive.)^</p>
}

Pragma cell_size_check {
    <p>^(<b>PRAGMA cell_size_check
       <br>PRAGMA cell_size_check = </b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>The cell_size_check pragma enables or disables additional sanity
    checking on database b-tree pages as they are initially read from disk.)^
    With cell size checking enabled, database corruption is detected earlier
    and is less likely to "spread".  However, there is a small performance
    hit for doing the extra checks and so cell size checking is turned off
    by default.
}

Pragma checkpoint_fullfsync {
    <p>^(<b>PRAGMA checkpoint_fullfsync

    ^If this flag is set, then the F_FULLFSYNC syncing method is used
    during checkpoint operations on systems that support F_FULLFSYNC. 
    ^The default value of the checkpoint_fullfsync flag
    is off.  Only Mac OS-X supports F_FULLFSYNC.</p>

    <p>^If the [fullfsync] flag is set, then the F_FULLFSYNC syncing
    method is used for all sync operations and the checkpoint_fullfsync
    setting is irrelevant.</p>

LegacyPragma count_changes {
    <p><b>PRAGMA count_changes;

    <p>Query or change the count-changes flag. Normally, when the
    count-changes flag is not set, [INSERT], [UPDATE] and [DELETE] statements
    return no data. When count-changes is set, each of these commands 
    returns a single row of data consisting of one integer value - the
    number of rows inserted, modified or deleted by the command. The 
    returned change count does not include any insertions, modifications
    or deletions performed by triggers, or any changes made automatically
    by [foreign key actions].</p>

    <p>Another way to get the row change counts is to use the
    [sqlite3_changes()] or [sqlite3_total_changes()] interfaces.
    There is a subtle different, though.  When an INSERT, UPDATE, or
    DELETE is run against a view using an [INSTEAD OF trigger],
    the count_changes pragma reports the number of rows in the view
    that fired the trigger, whereas [sqlite3_changes()] and
    [sqlite3_total_changes()] do not.

Pragma data_version {
    <p><b>PRAGMA DB.data_version;</b></p>
    <p>^The "PRAGMA data_version" command provides an indication that the

    Interactive programs that hold database content in memory or that
    display database content on-screen can use the PRAGMA data_version
    command to determine if they need to flush and reload their memory
    or update the screen display.</p>

    <p>^The integer values returned by two
    invocations of "PRAGMA data_version" from the same connection
    will be different if changes were committed to the database

    on the same database connection.
    ^The behavior of "PRAGMA data_version" is the same for all database
    connections, including database connections in separate processes
    and [shared cache] database connections.

    <p>^The "PRAGMA data_version" value is a local property of each
    database connection and so values returned by two concurrent invocations
    of "PRAGMA data_version" on separate database connections are 
    often different even though the underlying database is identical.
    It is only meaningful to compare the "PRAGMA data_version" values

    mode for <i>database</i>.  ^When <i>database</i> is omitted, the
    "main" database is queried.</p>

    <p>^The second form changes the journaling mode for "<i>database</i>"
    or for all attached databases if "<i>database</i>" is omitted.
    ^The new journal mode is returned.  ^If the journal mode
    could not be changed, the original journal mode is returned.</p>

    <p>^The DELETE journaling mode is the normal behavior.  ^In the DELETE
    mode, the rollback journal is deleted at the conclusion of each
    transaction.  Indeed, the delete operation is the action that causes
    the transaction to commit.
    (See the document titled <a href="atomiccommit.html">
    Atomic Commit In SQLite</a> for additional detail.)</p>

    <p>^The TRUNCATE journaling mode commits transactions by truncating
    the rollback journal to zero-length instead of deleting it.  On many
    systems, truncating a file is much faster than deleting the file since
    the containing directory does not need to be changed.</p>

    <p>^(The PERSIST journaling mode prevents the rollback journal from
    being deleted at the end of each transaction.  Instead, the header
    of the journal is overwritten with zeros.)^  This will prevent other
    database connections from rolling the journal back.  The PERSIST
    journaling mode is useful as an optimization on platforms where
    deleting or truncating a file is much more expensive than overwriting
    the first block of a file with zeros.  See also:
    [PRAGMA journal_size_limit] and [SQLITE_DEFAULT_JOURNAL_SIZE_LIMIT].</p>

    <p>^The MEMORY journaling mode stores the rollback journal in 
    volatile RAM.  ^This saves disk I/O but at the expense of database
    safety and integrity.  ^If the application using SQLite crashes in
    the middle of a transaction when the MEMORY journaling mode is set,
    then the database file will very likely 
    [cfgerrors|go corrupt].</p>

    <p>^The WAL journaling mode uses a [write-ahead log] instead of a
    rollback journal to implement transactions.  ^The WAL journaling mode
    is persistent; after being set it stays in effect
    across multiple database connections and after closing and
    reopening the database.  A database in WAL journaling mode
    can only be accessed by SQLite [version 3.7.0] ([dateof:3.7.0])
    or later.</p>

    <p>^The OFF journaling mode disables the rollback journal completely.
    ^No rollback journal is ever created and hence there is never a rollback
    journal to delete.  The OFF journaling mode disables the atomic
    commit and rollback capabilities of SQLite. The [ROLLBACK] command
    no longer works; it behaves in an undefined way.  Applications must
    avoid using the [ROLLBACK] command when the journal mode is OFF.
    ^If the application crashes
    in the middle of a transaction when the OFF journaling mode is
    set, then the database file will very likely
    [cfgerrors|go corrupt].</p>

    <p>^Note that the journal_mode for an [in-memory database]
    is either MEMORY or OFF and can not be changed to a different value.
    ^An attempt to change the journal_mode of an [in-memory database] to
    any setting other than MEMORY or OFF is ignored.  ^Note also that
    the journal_mode cannot be changed while a transaction is active.</p>

Pragma journal_size_limit {

  <p>^If a database connection is operating in
  [locking_mode | exclusive locking mode] or in
  [journal_mode | persistent journal mode] 
  (PRAGMA journal_mode=persist) then
  after committing a transaction the [rollback journal] file may remain in
  the file-system. This increases performance for subsequent transactions
  since overwriting an existing file is faster than append to a file,
  but it also consumes
  file-system space. After a large transaction (e.g. a [VACUUM]),
  the rollback journal file may consume a very large amount of space.

  <p>Similarly, in [WAL mode], the write-ahead log file is not truncated
  following a [checkpoint].  Instead, SQLite reuses the existing file
  for subsequent WAL entries since overwriting is faster than appending.

  <p>^The journal_size_limit pragma may be used to limit the size of 
  rollback-journal and WAL files left
  in the file-system after transactions or checkpoints.
  ^Each time a transaction is committed or a WAL file resets, SQLite 
  compares the size of the rollback journal file or WAL file left in 
  the file-system to the size limit
  set by this pragma and if the journal or WAL file is larger 
  it is truncated to the limit.

  <p>^The second form of the pragma listed above is used to set a new limit
  in bytes for the specified database.  ^A negative number implies no limit.
  ^To always truncate rollback journals and WAL files to their minimum size, 
  set the journal_size_limit to zero.
  ^Both the first and second forms of the pragma listed above return a single
  result row containing a single integer column - the value of the journal
  size limit in bytes. ^The default journal size limit is -1 (no limit).  The
  [SQLITE_DEFAULT_JOURNAL_SIZE_LIMIT] preprocessor macro can be used to change
  the default journal size limit at compile-time.</p>

  <p>^This pragma only operates on the single database specified prior
  to the pragma name (or on the "main" database if no database is specified.)
  There is no way to change the journal size limit on all attached databases
  using a single PRAGMA statement.  The size limit must be set separately for
  each attached database.

    ^The locking-mode is either NORMAL or EXCLUSIVE.

    <p>^In NORMAL locking-mode (the default unless overridden at compile-time
    using [SQLITE_DEFAULT_LOCKING_MODE]), a database connection
    unlocks the database file at the conclusion of each read or
    write transaction. ^When the locking-mode is set to EXCLUSIVE, the
    database connection never releases file-locks. ^The first time the
    database is read in EXCLUSIVE mode, a shared lock is obtained and 
    held. ^The first time the database is written, an exclusive lock is
    obtained and held.</p>

    <p>^Database locks obtained by a connection in EXCLUSIVE mode may be
    released either by closing the database connection, or by setting the
    locking-mode back to NORMAL using this pragma and then accessing the
    database file (for read or write). ^Simply setting the locking-mode to
    NORMAL is not enough - locks are not released until the next time
    the database file is accessed.</p>

    <p>There are three reasons to set the locking-mode to EXCLUSIVE.
    <ol>
    <li>^The application wants to prevent other processes from
        accessing the database file.
    <li>^The number of system calls for filesystem operations is reduced,
        possibly resulting in a small performance increase.

        use of shared memory.

  <p>This pragma is usually a no-op or nearly so and is very fast.

    <p>SQLite makes no

    sometimes new versions of SQLite will contain optimizer enhancements

    to shift.  When that happens, applications that depend on a certain
    output order might malfunction.  By running the application multiple
    times with this pragma both disabled and enabled, cases where the
    application makes faulty assumptions about output order can be
    identified and fixed early, reducing problems
    that might be caused by linking against a different version of SQLite.

    ^The first (query) form will return the synchronous setting as an

    The meanings of the various synchronous settings are as follows:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>EXTRA</b> (3)</dt>
    <dd>
    ^EXTRA synchronous is like FULL with the addition that the directory
    containing a [rollback journal] is synced after that journal is unlinked
    to commit a transaction in DELETE mode.  EXTRA provides additional
    durability if the commit is followed closely by a power loss.</dd>
    <dt><b>FULL</b> (2)</dt>
    <dd>
    ^When synchronous is FULL (2), the SQLite database engine will
    use the xSync method of the [VFS] to ensure that all content is safely
    written to the disk surface prior to continuing.
    This ensures that an operating system crash or power failure will
    not corrupt the database.
    FULL synchronous is very safe, but it is also slower.  FULL is the
    most commonly used synchronous setting when not in [WAL mode].</dd>
    <dt><b>NORMAL</b> (1)</dt>
    <dd>
    ^When synchronous is NORMAL (1), the SQLite database
    engine will still sync at the most critical moments, but less often
    than in FULL mode.  There is a very small (though non-zero) chance that
    a power failure at just the wrong time could corrupt the database in
    NORMAL mode.  But in practice, you are more likely to suffer
    a catastrophic disk failure or some other unrecoverable hardware
    fault.  Many applications choose NORMAL when in [WAL mode].</dd>
    <dt><b>OFF</b> (0)</dt>
    <dd>
    ^With synchronous OFF (0), SQLite continues without syncing
    as soon as it has handed data off to the operating system.
    If the application running SQLite crashes, the data will be safe, but
    the database [cfgerrors|might become corrupted] if the operating system
    crashes or the computer loses power before that data has been written
    to the disk surface.  On the other hand, commits can be orders of
    magnitude faster with synchronous OFF.
    </dd></dl>
    </p>
 
    <p>^In [WAL] mode when synchronous is NORMAL (1), the WAL file is
    synchronized before each [checkpoint] and the database file is
    synchronized after each completed [checkpoint] and the WAL file
    header is synchronized when a WAL file begins to be reused after
    a checkpoint, but no sync operations occur during most transactions.
    ^With synchronous=FULL in WAL mode, an additional
    sync operation of the WAL file happens after each transaction commit.
    The extra WAL sync following each transaction help ensure that 
    transactions are durable across a power loss.  Transactions are
    consistent with or without the extra syncs provided by
    synchronous=FULL.
    If durability is not a concern, then synchronous=NORMAL is normally
    all one needs in WAL mode.</p>

    <p>^The default setting is usually synchronous=FULL.
    The [SQLITE_EXTRA_DURABLE] compile-time option changes the
    default to synchronous=EXTRA.</p>

    <p>The TEMP schema always has synchronous=OFF since the content of

      [sqlite3_wal_checkpoint()] C interface.)^ ^(The
      [sqlite3_busy_handler|busy-handler callback] is never invoked in
      this mode.)^
   
    ^(<dt>FULL<dd>
      This mode blocks 
      (invokes the [sqlite3_busy_handler|busy-handler callback])
      until there is no
      database writer and all readers are reading from the most recent database
      snapshot. It then checkpoints all frames in the log file and syncs the
      database file.)^ ^(FULL blocks concurrent writers while it is
      running, but readers can proceed.)^
   
    ^(<dt>RESTART<dd>
      This mode works the same way as FULL with the addition that after 
      checkpointing the log file it blocks (calls the 
      [sqlite3_busy_handler|busy-handler callback])
      until all readers are finished with the log file.)^ This ensures 
      that the next client to write to the database file restarts the log file 
      from the beginning. ^(RESTART blocks concurrent writers while it is
      running, but allowed readers to proceed.)^
   
    ^(<dt>TRUNCATE<dd>
      This mode works the same way as RESTART with the 
      addition that the WAL file is truncated to zero bytes upon successful
      completion.)^

    <p>^The wal_checkpoint pragma returns a single row with three
    integer columns.  ^The first column is usually 0 but will be
    1 if a RESTART or FULL or TRUNCATE checkpoint was blocked from completing,
    for example because another thread or process was actively
    using the database.  ^In other words, the first column is 0 if the
    equivalent call to [sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()] would have returned
    [SQLITE_OK] or 1 if the equivalent call would have returned [SQLITE_BUSY].
    ^The second column is the number of modified pages that have been
    written to the write-ahead log file.
    ^The third column is the number of pages in the write-ahead log file
    that have been successfully moved back into the database file at
    the conclusion of the checkpoint.
   ^The second and third column are -1 if there is no
    write-ahead log, for example if this pragma is invoked on a database
    connection that is not in [WAL mode].</p>
